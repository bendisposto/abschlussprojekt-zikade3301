                    Course description: Big Data is one of the main buzz words nowadays, being a primary focus both for aca-demic research and for industry. Big Data has emerged as a revolution driven by the continuous increasing volumes of data that are being collected at increasing velocities from various source: social networks, IoT, scientific simulations, finance, weather forecasting, etc. Tackling such challenges, commonly referred to as the V’s of Big Data, has lead to the development of a plethora of technologies and concepts. Batch and stream processing are the main classes of dealing with the data, which can be either offline or in real time. Starting from these two categories, different programming models such as MapReduce or reactive program-ming have beenrecently proposed. Additionally multiple technologies have been, and are developed to facili-tate the processing and the data management of Big Data scenarios: HDFS, MapReduce, Spark, Storm, -Flink, Kafka, HBase, Hive, etc. All these form today the Hadoop ecosystem. This course aims to give an in-troduction to technologies and concepts that build the Hadoop ecosystem, both as lecture courses and prac-tical sessions. From the point of view of the lecture courses the focus lays with giving the theoretical back-grounds of the concepts and mechanisms that enable Big Data processing. The course will present the dif-ferent programming models, strategies to deal with large data sets or with data sets on the fly (e.g., MapRe-duce and MapReduce pipelines, Stream topologies, Windows, SQL and Hive Queries and interactive que-ries). From the point of view of the practical sessions the objective is to make the students familiar with the main Big Data processing tools used today in industry such as MapReduce, HDFS, Spark, Flink, HBase, Kafka. At the end of the course the students will have a good understanding of feasible approaches to ad-dress various Big Data scenarios as well as hands-on experience with some of the most commonly used Ha-doop tools.

                    Course Topics to be addressed:

                    * Overview of Big Data: what it is, why it has emerged and future trends
                    * Data models and large scale infrastructures (cluster, grid, cloud, HPC)
                    * Batch processing
                      * Distributed storage systems concepts: GFC, HDFS and Cloud Public Storage (Azure Blobs and AWS S3)
                      * NoSQL storage and distributed message queues
                      * Google MapReduce programming model and Hadoop MapReduce
                      * High level semantics processing tools for offline data: Spark, Hive, Pig, Flink
                    * Stream processing:
                      * Stream overview: what it is and what are the main difference with respect to batch processing,
                      * Stream concepts for data processing: operators, windows, sinks, ETLs
                    * Project topics

                    Evaluation:

                    * Project: A topic will be choosen from multiple available ones (sentiment analysis, twitter trends analy-sis, internet/social media search, ...)
                    * Solution: A software solution will be design, built and delivered as the outcome of the project.
                    * Technology: The solution will be built using multiple advanced technologies covered in the course.
                    * Evaluation: The solutiondesign will be presented together with a demo to show the specific use case.
